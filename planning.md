## Understanding

 - Speed is a fixed value set my a static variable.
 - The size of the player and "treasure" are statically set as well.
 - X and Y systems are established by dividing the height and width of the screen, allowing us to have an origin!
 - player_rect and treasure_rect are hitboxes.
 - The location that the treasure can spawn has its RNG bounded by the X/Y boundings.
